# Bitburner-scripts

This is a repository containing all manner of scripts for bitburner.  All of them were written by me,  with a few scripts containing small portions of AI generated code and some (better written) code comments.  

Feel free to use them in your own game, but I would recommend trying to figure things out by yourself, with only the help of the game documentation.  

The scripts are in no way guaranteed to be (the most) optimal.
